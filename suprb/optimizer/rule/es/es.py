class ES1xLambda(ParallelSingleRuleGeneration):
    """ The 1xLambda Evolutionary Strategy, where x is in {,+&}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_iter: int
        Iterations to evolve a rule.
    lmbda: int
        Children to generate in every iteration.
    operator: str
        Can be one of ',', '+' or '&'.
        ',' replaces the elitist in every generation.
        '+' may keep the elitist.
        '&' is a hybrid approach that essentially performs ',' but with elitists being archived and 
            it ends the optimization process, if no improvement is found in delay generations.
    delay: int
        Only relevant if operator is '&'. Controls the number of elitists which need to be worse before stopping.
    origin_generation: RuleOriginGeneration
        The selection process which decides on the next initial points.
    init: RuleInit
    mutation: RuleMutation
        Default is HalfnormIncrease(sigma=1.22)
    selection: RuleSelection
    acceptance: RuleAcceptance
    constraint: RuleConstraint
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
    n_jobs: int
        The number of threads / processes the optimization uses. Currently not used for this optimizer.
